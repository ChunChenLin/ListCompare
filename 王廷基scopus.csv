Our problem does not have precoloring solutions of cells as the input, and it allows using techniques, including white space insertion, cell flipping, adjacent-cell swapping, and vertical cell movement, to optimize the solution quality. We first present (resource-constrained) shortest-path-based algorithms for several TPL-aware single-row placement problems that allow or disallow perturbing a given cell ordering. Based on these algorithms, we then propose an approach to our TPL-aware detailed placement refinement problem, which first minimizes the number of stitches and then minimizes the wirelength. Finally, we report extensive experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. © 1982-2012 IEEE.","Detailed Placement Refinement; Layout Decomposition; Triple Patterning Lithography","Cells; Lithography; Cell movement; Detailed Placement Refinement; Effectiveness and efficiencies; Layout decomposition; Minimizing the number of; Placement problems; Solution quality; Triple patterning; Cytology",,,,,,"(2013) NanGate FreePDK45 Generic Open Cell Library, , http://www.si2.org/openeda.si2.org/projects/nangatelib, (May 1 [Online].

This paper presents an unroutable placement recognizer based on a window-based unroutable region recognition algorithm and a length-bounded unroutable panel recognition (UPR) algorithm, which can confirm some placements that are exactly unroutable among a set of hard-to-route placements. In addition, if a placement is recognized to be unroutable, the recognizer can report a lower bound of total overflow for the placement. The experimental results reveal that the unroutable region recognition algorithm can find out 16 placements that are definitely unroutable among 23 widely used hard-to-route global routing benchmarks. Moreover, when a scenic constraint is considered, the UPR algorithm can find out a few more placements that are also unroutable. © 1982-2012 IEEE.","global routing; Placement; routability","Iterative methods; Routers; Global routers; Global routing; Placement; Region recognition; Region-based; Routability; State of the art; Window-based; Algorithms",,,,,"103-2220-E-007-001, MOST, Ministry of Science and Technology","ISPD, (2008) Global Routing Contest and Benchmark Suite.

Recently, global-routing-based routing congestion estimators (GRCEs) are widely used to detect the routability problems in the early VLSI design stages. To make GRCEs fast, using parallel routing approaches to speed up GRCEs is a promising direction. However, integrating existing parallel routing approaches into a GRCE may degrade the accuracy of the GRCE, because the routing kernel of the GRCE has to be modified such that its routing behavior changes. This paper presents a resource-level parallel approach (RPA) to accelerate GRCEs. RPA is easy to implement and has no need to change the routing kernels of GRCEs. Thus, GRCEs accelerated by RPA can keep its routing behavior and the estimation accuracy. Moreover, this paper presents an analytical method to quantify the estimation accuracy of a GRCE. Traditionally, the accuracy of a GRCE is manually measured by how they look like between the congestion maps generated by the GRCE and a real router, which may be inaccurate and time-consuming. In contrast, using the proposed quantifying method to evaluate the accuracy of a GRCE is more precise and faster. © 2014 IEEE.",,"Computer aided design; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Analytical method; Behavior change; Congestion maps; Global routing; Parallel routing; Resource levels; Routing congestion; Scaling down; Design",,,,,,"He, X., Ripple: An effective routability-driven placer by iterative cell movement (2011) Proc.

The remaining routing resources, however, could become so limited after RVI, and make engineering change order (ECO) routing during a pre-mask stage or even a post-mask stage difficult to complete. In this paper, we study an ECO routing problem where redundant vias are present in the given layout but can be considered for replacement or removal to increase the routability and improve the routing quality. To find an ECO routing path, we construct only the necessary part of the routing graph on-the-fly, and develop an A- search based algorithm for achieving efficient path finding. We also take redundant via replacement, removal, and insertion into account when formulating the routing cost, and apply a state-of-the-art method to perform redundant via replacement and insertion. Experiments show that our algorithm not only successfully routes all test cases but also efficiently produces high-quality solutions. © 2014 IEEE.",,"Chip reliability; Engineering change orders; High-quality solutions; Nano-meter scale; Redundant via insertion; Routing resources; Search-based algorithms; State-of-the-art methods; Computer aided design; Microprocessor chips; Algorithms",,,,,,"Chang, H.-Y., Jiang, I.H.-R., Chang, Y.-W., Simultaneous functional and timing eco (2011) Proceedings of Design Automation Conference, pp. 140-145; Chen, H.-Y., Chiang, M.-F., Chang, Y.-W., Chen, L., Han, B., Fullchip routing considering double-via insertion (2008) IEEE Transactions on Computer-aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems, 27 (5), pp. 844-857; Cong, J., Fang, J., Khoo, K.-Y., An implicit connection graph maze routing algorithm for eco routing (1999) Proceedings of International Conference on Computer-aided Design, pp. 163-167; Fang, S.-Y., Chien, T.-F., Chang, Y.-W., Redundant-wires-aware eco timing and mask cost optimization (2010) Proceedings of International Conference on Computer-aided Design, pp. 381-386; Guttman, A., R-trees: A dynamic index structure for spatial searching (1984) Proceedings of International Conference on Management of Data, pp. 47-57; Hart, P., Nilsson, N., Raphael, B., A formal basis for the heuristic determination of minimum cost paths (1968) IEEE Transactions on Systems Science and Cybernetics, 4 (2), pp. 100-107; Lee, K.-Y., Koh, C.-K., Wang, T.-C., Chao, K.-Y., Fast and optimal redundant via insertion (2008) IEEE Transactions on Computer-aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems, 27 (12), pp. 2197-2208; Li, Y.-L., Li, J.-Y., Chen, W.-B., An efficient tile-based eco router using routing graph reduction and enhanced global routing flow (2007) IEEE Transactions on Computer-aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems, 26 (2), pp. 345-358; Lin, C.-T., Lin, Y.-H., Su, G.-C., Li, Y.-L., Dead via minimization by simultaneous routing and redundant via insertion (2010) Proceedings of Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference, pp. 657-662; Pan, D.Z., Cho, M., Yuan, K., Manufacturability aware routing in nanometer vlsi (2010) Foundations and Trends in Electronic Design Automation, 4 (1), pp. 1-97; Scheffer, L., Recommended rules not recommended (2006) Speech Presented at Electronic Design Processes Workshop; Xu, G., Huang, L.-D., Pan, D.Z., Wong, M.D.F., Redundant-via enhanced maze routing for yield improvement (2005) Proceedings of Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference, pp. 1148-1151","Department of Computer Science, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan",,"ACM SIGDA;IEEE Council on Electronic Design Automation (CEDA);IEEE Circuits and Systems Society (CAS);IEEE Circuits and Systems - Singapore Chapter",,"2014 19th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference, ASP-DAC 2014","20 January 2014 through 23 January 2014","Suntec",103285,,9781479928163,,,"English","Proc Asia South Pac Des Autom Conf",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84897855091

This paper presents an unroutable placement recognizer based on a window-based layout scanning algorithm, which can confirm some placements that are exactly unroutable among a set of hard-to-route placements. In addition, if a placement is recognized to be unroutable, the recognizer can point out unroutable regions and report a lower bound of total overflow for the placement. The experimental results reveal that the proposed recognizer can find out 16 placements that are definitely unroutable among 23 widely used hard-to-route global routing benchmarks.",,"Iterative methods; Global routers; Global routing; Lower bounds; Routability; Runtimes; Scanning algorithms; Window-based; Routers",,,,,,"ISPD 2008 Global Routing Contest and Benchmark Suite, , http://archivesigda.org/ispd2008/contests/ispd08rc.html; Moffitt, M.D., Sze, C.N., Wire synthesizable global routing for timing closure (2011) Proc.

However, the floorplan of dies on the interposer and the signal assignment for macro-bumps and TSVs will largely impact the wirelength of the interconnects in a 2.5D IC. Because long interconnects would degrade the performance of 2.5D ICs, the multi-die floorplanning problem and signal assignment problem for 2.5D ICs are critical. This paper presents an enumeration-based algorithm and a network-flow-based algorithm to solve the multi-die floorplanning and signal assignment problems in a 2.5D IC, respectively. Also, to speed up the floorplanning and signal assignment algorithms, several acceleration techniques are proposed. The experimental results reveal that this work can effectively reduce the total wirelength in a 2.5D IC and the acceleration techniques can significantly speed up the proposed algorithms.

However, because of the forbidden pitch issue in sub-20nm designs, wide wires may no longer be an attractive solution because of the restrictive wire spacing requirement from advanced lithography. In this work, we investigate the suitability of the parallel wiring technique, in which multiple parallel wires are used to route the same net, as an alternative to routing a net using a single wide wire. In particular, we study the trade offs between parasitics, timing, power, and routing resources. Our study reveals that wire sizing using both parallel wires and wide wires can be advantageous. Moreover, if high layout densities are required, parallel wiring can be a viable approach in solving timing problems for sub-20nm designs. © 2014 ACM.","interconnects; parallel wires; physical design; routing; VLSI","Optical interconnects; Wire; Advanced lithography; Attractive solutions; Layout densities; Parallel wires; Physical design; routing; Routing resources; VLSI; Design",,,,,,"Agarwal, K.B., Banerjee, S., Integrated model-based retargeting and optical proximity correction (2011) SPIE, pp. 79740F-79740F10; Ando, T., Takeshita, M., Takasu, R., Yoshii, Y., Iwashita, J., Matsumaru, S., Abe, S., Iwai, T., Pattern freezing process free litho-litho-etch double patterning (2008) SPIE, pp. 71402H-71402H8; Cobb, N.B., Zakhor, A., Large-area phase-shift mask design (1994) SPIE, pp. 348-360; Cong, J., Koh, C.-K., Simultaneous driver and wire sizing for performance and power optimization (1994) Very Large Scale Integration Systems, pp. 408-425; Cong, J., Leung, K., Zhou, D., Performance-driven interconnect design based on distributed RC delay model (1993) DAC, pp. 606-611; Fu, C.-C., Tungsheng, Y., Stone, D.R., Enhancement of lithographic patterns by using serif features (1991) Electron Devices, pp. 2599-2603; Gao, T., Liu, C., Minimum crosstalk channel routing (1993) ICCAD, pp. 692-696; Harazaki, K., Hasegawa, Y., Shichijo, Y., Tabuchi, H., Fujii, K., High accurate optical proximity correction under the influences of lens aberration in 0.15 μm logic process (2000) Microprocesses and Nanotechnology Conference, pp. 14-15; Roadmap 2011, , http://www.itrs.net/links/2011itrs/home2011.html; Kim, M.-C., Hu, J., Lee, D., Markov, I.L., A simplr method for routability-driven placement (2011) ICCAD, pp. 80-84; Krasnoperova, A., Culp, J.A., Graur, I., Mansfield, S., Al-Imam, M., Maaty, H., Process window OPC for reduced process variability and enhanced yield (2006) SPIE, pp. 1200-1211; Laidler, D., Leray, P., Dhave, K., Cheng, S., Sources of overlay error in double patterning integration schemes (2008) SPIE, pp. 69221E-69221E11; Lillis, J., Cheng, C.-K., Lin, T.-T.Y., Optimal wire sizing and buffer insertion for low power and a generalized delay model (1995) ICCAD, pp. 138-143; Lillis, J., Cheng, C.-K., Lin, T.-T.Y., Simultaneous routing and buffer insertion for high performance interconnect (1996) GLSVLSI, pp. 148-155; Liu, W.-H., Kao, W.-C., Li, Y.-L., Chao, K.-Y., Nctu-gr 2.0: Multithreaded collision-aware global routing with bounded-length maze routing (2013) On CAD of Integrated Circuits and Systems, pp. 709-722; Nabors, K., White, J., FastCap: A multipole accelerated 3-D capacitance extraction program (1991) Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems, pp. 1447-1459; http://ngspice.sourceforge.net/Phillips, J., White, J., A precorrected-FFT method for electrostatic analysis of complicated 3-D structures (1997) Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems, pp. 1059-1072; Sapatnekar, S., RC interconnect optimization under the elmore delay model (1994) DAC, pp. 387-391; Sze, C., ISPD 2010 high performance clock network synthesis contest: Benchmark suit and results (2010) ISPD, pp. 143-143; Van Ginneken, L., Buffer placement in distributed RC-tree networks for minimal elmore delay (1990) Circuits and Systems, pp. 865-868; Viswanathan, N., Alpert, C., Sze, C., Li, Z., Wei, Y., ICCAD-2012 CAD contest in design hierarchy aware routability-driven placement and benchmark suite (2012) ICCAD, pp. 345-348; Yang, E., Li, C.H., Kang, X.H., Guo, E., Model-based retarget for 45nm node and beyond (2009) SPIE, pp. 727428-7274288; Yehia Hamouda, A., Word, J., Anis, M., Karim, K.S., Aerial image retargeting (AIR): Achieving litho-friendly designs (2011) SPIE, pp. 797411-7974118; Zhang, H., Deng, Y., Kye, J., Wong, M.D.F., Impact of lithography retargeting process on low level interconnect in 20nm technology (2012) SLIP, pp. 3-10",,,"ACM Special Interest Group on Design Automation (SIGDA)","Association for Computing Machinery","24th Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI, GLSVLSI 2014","21 May 2014 through 23 May 2014","Houston, TX",105609,,9781450328166,,,"English","Proc.

In an interposer, routing wires connect signals between dies or route signals from dies to the package substrate. The number of metal layers in an interposer is one of the critical factors to affect the routability and manufacturing cost of the 2.5D IC. Thus, how to achieve 100% routing completion rate in an interposer using a minimum number of metal layers plays a key role for the success of a 2.5D IC. This paper presents a global-routing-based metal layer planner called VGR to identify a minimal number of metal layers for an interposer with consideration of routability and manufacturing cost. Also, VGR can identify a good stacking order of the horizontal and vertical layers in an interposer such that the routing solution in the interposer costs fewer vias.

To deal with multiple routing layers and preferred routing orientations, we consider the multilayer obstacle-avoiding rectilinear Steiner minimal tree (ML-OARSMT) problem and the obstacle-avoiding preferred direction Steiner tree (OAPD-ST) problem. First, we prove that the multilayer case is theoretically different from the 2D one, and propose a reduction to transform a multilayer instance into a 3D instance. Based on the reduction, we apply computational geometry techniques to develop an efficient algorithm, utilizing existing OARSMT heuristics, for the ML-OARSMT problem and the OAPD-ST problem. Furthermore, we develop an advanced Steiner point selection to avoid inferior Steiner points and to improve the solution quality. Experimental results show that our algorithm provides a solution with excellent quality and has a significant speed-up compared to previously known results. © 2014 IEEE.","Obstacle-Avoidance; Physical Design; Rectilinear Steiner Minimal Tree (RSMT); Routing","Algorithms; Collision avoidance; Computational efficiency; Computational geometry; Heuristic methods; Multilayers; Geometric reductions; Obstacle-Avoidance; Physical design; Rectilinear steiner minimal trees (RSMT); Rectilinear steiner trees; Routing; Routing orientation; Steiner minimal tree; Trees (mathematics)",,,,,"103-2220-E-007-001, MOST, Ministry of Science and Technology; 103-2221-E-005-042, MOST, Ministry of Science and Technology; 103-2221-E-005-043, MOST, Ministry of Science and Technology","Liu, C.-H., Chen, I.-C., Lee, D.T., An efficient algorithm for multilayer obstacle-avoiding rectilinear Steiner tree construction (2012) Proc. 49th ACM/EDAC/IEEE Design Autom.

Recently, most research works have concentrated on improving global placement and legalization, but innovations in DP have been rarely seen. ICCAD13 held a DP contest that formulates the emerging placement issues into a bin-utilization metric and maximum cell displacement constraint. This paper presents a detailed placer that can effectively reduce both half-perimeter wirelength and the peak bin-utilization under the displacement constraint. The proposed lazy-update based incremental density profit function supports efficient cell swapping. Combination of lazy-update density profit function and Density-Driven Swap lets our placer achieve AOFP of 0 for the majority of the ICCAD13 test cases. The placer presented produces the best placement results among the top3 teams in the ICCAD13 contest.

Although these techniques have been studied extensively, we have found that both conventional polling and collaborative timing synchronization approaches all encounter a severe scalability issue when the number of target cores is more than that of the host cores. To resolve this issue, we propose an effective hybrid technique that combines the advantage of the two approaches. According to the experimental results, the proposed technique effectively resolves the scalability issue and shows one to four orders of improvement compared to conventional approaches. © 2013 IEEE.","Multi-core Instruction-set simulator; Timing Synchronization","Conventional approach; Hybrid synchronizations; Hybrid techniques; Instruction set simulations; Instruction-set simulator; Multi-core systems; System development; Timing synchronization; Computer aided design; Scalability; Synchronization",,,,,,"Kim, H., Scalable and retargetable simulation techniques for multiprocessor systems (2009) Presented at the Proceedings of the 7th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Hardware/software Codesign and System Synthesis, Grenoble, France; Miller, J.E., Graphite: A distributed parallel simulator for multicores (2010) High Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA), 2010 IEEE 16th International Symposium on, pp. 1-12; Meng-Huan, W., A high-parallelism distributed scheduling mechanism for multi-core instruction-set simulation (2011) Design Automation Conference (DAC), 2011 48th ACM/EDAC/IEEE, pp. 339-344; Wu, M.-H., Automatic generation of software TLM in multiple abstraction layers for efficient HW/SW co-simulation (2010) Presented at the Proceedings of the Conference on Design, Automation and Test in Europe, Dresden, Germany; Burger, D., Austin, T.M., The simplescalar tool set, version 2. 0 (1997) SIGARCH Comput.

Unlike conventional vias, TSVs occupy device area and are very large compared to logic gates. However, most previous 3-D floorplanners only view TSVs as points. As a result, whitespace redistribution is necessary for TSV insertion after the initial floorplan is computed, which leads to suboptimal layouts. In this paper, we propose a very efficient 3-D floorplanner to simultaneously floorplan the functional modules and place the TSVs and to optimize the total wirelength under fixed-outline constraint. Compared to the state-of-the-art 3-D floorplanner with TSV planning, our design consistently produces better floorplans with 15% shorter wirelength and 31% fewer TSVs on average. Our algorithm is extremely fast and only takes a few seconds to floorplan benchmarks with hundreds of modules compared to hours as required by the previous state-of-the-art floorplanner. © 1993-2012 IEEE.","3-D floorplanning; 3-D IC; fixed-outline floorplanning; through-silicon vias (TSVs); TSV placement","Fixed-outline; Fixed-outline floorplanning; Floor-planning; Floorplans; Functional modules; Through silicon vias; Tsv insertions; TSV placement; Wire length; Hardware; Electrical engineering",,,,,,"Noice, D., Gerousis, V., (2010) Physical Design Implementation for 3-D IC: Methodology and Tools.

Pad assignment, which assigns inter-die signals to die pads so as to facilitate wire bonding, is an important physical design problem for SiP design because the quality of a pad assignment solution affects both the cost and the performance of an SiP design. In this paper, we study a pad assignment problem, which prohibits the generation of illegal crossings and aims to minimize the total signal wirelength, for die-stacking SiP design. We first consider the two-die cases and die-stacks with a bridging die, and present a minimum-cost flow-based approach to optimally solve them in polynomial time. We then describe an approach, which uses a modified left-edge algorithm and an integer linear programming technique, for pyramid die-stacks with no bridging die. Finally, we discuss extensions of the two approaches to handle additional design constraints. Encouraging experimental results are shown to support our approaches. © 1982-2012 IEEE.","Die-stack; pad assignment; system-in-package; wire bonding","Assignment problems; Assignment solutions; Design constraints; Die-stack; Integer Linear Programming; pad assignment; Physical design; Polynomial-time; SIP design; System in package; Wire bonding; Wire length; Cost accounting; Design; Integer programming; Polynomial approximation; Dies",,,,,,"Lin, Y.-C., Mak, W.-K., Chu, C., Wang, T.-C., Pad assignment for die-stacking system-in-package design (2009) Proc.

Although literature is abundant on 3D-IC floorplanning, none of them consider the areas and positions of signal through-silicon vias (TSVs). In previous research, signal TSVs are viewed as points during the floorplanning stage. Ignoring the areas, positions and connections of signal TSVs, previous research estimates wirelength by measuring the half-perimeter wirelength of pins in a net only. Experimental results reveal that 29.7% of nets possess signal TSVs that cannot be put into the white space within the bounding boxes of pins. Moreover, the total wirelength is underestimated by 26.8% without considering the positions of signal TSVs. The considerable error in wirelength estimation severely degrades the optimality of the floorplan result. Therefore, in this paper, we will propose a two-stage 3-D fixed-outline floorplaning algorithm. Stage one simultaneously plans hard macros and TSV-blocks for wirelength reduction. Stage two improves the wirelength by reassigning signal TSVs. Experimental results show that stage one outperforms a post-processing TSV planning algorithm in successful rate by 57%. Compared to the post-processing TSV planning algorithm, the average wirelength of our result is shorter by 22.3%. In addition, stage two further reduces the wirelength by 3.45% without any area overhead. © 2010 IEEE.","3D-IC; floorplan; TSV block; TSV planning","3-D integrated circuit; 3D-IC; Area overhead; Bounding box; Fixed-outline; Floor-planning; Floorplans; Hard macro; Optimality; Planning algorithms; Post processing; Through silicon vias; TSV block; TSV planning; Two stage; White space; Wire length; Wire length estimation; Algorithms; Electronics packaging; Three dimensional",,,,,,"Cong, J., Liu, C., Luo, G., Quantitative studies of impact of 3D IC design on repeater usage (2008) Proc.

In order to boost the research and development of global routing techniques, ISPD held contests and released benchmarks in 2007 and 2008, respectively. However, the contests may lead researchers away from facing other real problems in practice. In this paper we study a new global routing problem that not only considers traditional routing objectives such as overflow and wirelength but also focuses on honoring layer directives that are usually specified for timing-critical nets to alleviate performance degrading. Based on novel extensions of an academic router, we present a new global router called GLADE for the addressed problem.

In this paper, we study a layer assignment problem that arises during multi-layer global routing and takes antenna avoidance into account. The problem asks to transform a given 2-dimensional global routing result into a 3-dimensional one (i.e., a multi-layer one) and to minimize the amount of antenna violations and the via count subject to given wire congestion constraints. We present an algorithm that tackles the addressed layer assignment problem in a netby-net manner. An existing dynamic-programming- based single-net layer assignment method that can only consider the via count Is judiciously modified and adopted by our algorithm to handle both antenna avoidance and via count minimization for each net. To further reduce the via count but without increasing the amount of antenna violations, a refinement procedure based on min-cost max-flow is developed and added to our algorithm. The experiment results show that when compared with the layer assignment approach adopted by a state-of-the-art academic global router, our algorithm not only can improve the via count slightly but also can significantly reduce the amount of antenna violations. © 2010 IEEE.",,"3-dimensional; Antenna avoidance; Antenna effects; Global routers; Global routing; Layer assignment; Wire congestion; Algorithms; Computer aided design; Dynamic programming; Optimization; Routing protocols; Antennas",,,,,,"Lee, T.-H., Wang, T.-C., Congestion-constrained layer assignment for Via minimization in global routing (2008) IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems, 27 (9), pp. 1643-1656; (2007) Global Routing Contest, , http://www.sigda.org/ispd2007/contest.html, ISPD [Online].

Although there is abundant literature on 3D-IC floorplanning, none of them consider the areas and positions of signal through-silicon vias (TSVs). In previous research, TSVs are viewed as points during the floorplanning stage. Ignoring the areas, positions and connections of TSVs, previous research plans TSVs dispersively and estimates the wirelength by measuring the bounding box of pins in a net only. Moreover, although thermal issue is critical, there is a trade-off between wirelength and maximum temperature. Aggressively reducing the temperature may sacrifice the wirelength and impact the performance. Therefore, in this paper, we will propose a 3D floorplaning algorithm which simultaneously plans hard macros and TSV-blocks to minimize the wirelength and the maximum on-chip temperature. Experimental results show that our algorithm achieves high successful rate. Compared to the average wirelength of a postprocessing TSV planning algorithm, our result is shorter by 22.3%. In addition, we also compare our algorithm to a 3D fixed-outline floorplanner without considering thermal issue. The result shows that, our algorithm effectively reduces the maximum on-chip temperature by 45% at the expense of 3.9% increase in wirelength. © 2010 IEEE.",,"Bounding box; Fixed-outline; Floor-planning; Hard macro; Maximum temperature; On-chip temperature; Planning algorithms; Research plans; Through silicon vias; Through-silicon via; Wire length; Electronics packaging; Three dimensional; Algorithms",,,,,,"Cong, J., Liu, C., Luo, G., Quantitative studies of impact of 3D IC design on repeater usage (2008) Proceedings of International VLSI/ULSI Multilevel Interconnection Conference, pp. 344-348; Reif, R., Fan, A., Chen, K.-N., Das, S., Fabrication technologies for three-dimensional integrated circuits (2002) Proceedings of Internaltional Symposium on Quality Electronic Design, pp. 33-37; Tai, K.L., System-in-package (SIP): Challenges and opportunities (2000) Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference, pp. 191-196; Shiu, P.-H., Ravichandran, R., Easwar, S., Lim, S.K., Multi-layer floorplanning for reliable system-on-package (2004) International Symposium on Circuits and Systems, 5, pp. 69-72; Cong, J., Jie, W., Zhang, Y., A thermal-driven floorplan for 3D-ICs (2004) International Conference on Computer Aided Design, pp. 306-313; Li, Z., Hong, X.-L., Zhou, Q., Zeng, S., Yang, H., Pitchumani, V., Cheng, C.-K., Integrating dynamic thermal via planning with 3D floorplanning algorithm (2006) International Symposium on Physical Design, pp. 178-185; Zhou, P.-Q., Ma, Y.-C., Li, Z.-Y., Dick, R.P., Li, S., Zhou, H., Hong, X.-L., Zhou, Q., 3D-STAF: Scalable temperature and leakage aware floorplanning for three-dimensional integrated circuits (2007) International Conference on Computer-Aided Design, pp. 590-597; Goplen, B., Sapatnekar, S., Placement of 3D ICs with thermal and interlayer via considerations (2007) Design Automation Conference, pp. 626-631; Cong, J., Luo, G.-J., Wei, J., Zhang, Y., Thermal-aware 3D IC placement via transformation (2007) Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference, pp. 780-785; Li, J., Miyashita, H., Post-placement thermal via planning for 3D integrated circuit (2006) Asia Pacific Conference on Circuits and Systems, pp. 808-811; Cong, J., Zhang, Y., Thermal via planning for 3-D ICs (2005) International Conference on Computer-Aided Design, pp. 745-752; Zhang, T., Zhan, Y., Sapatnekar, S., Temperature-aware routing in 3D ICs (2006) Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference, pp. 308-314; Wolf, M.J., Ramm, P., Klumpp, A., Reichl, H., Technologies for 3D wafer levell heterogeneous integration (2008) Symposium on Design, Test, Integration and Packaging of MEMS/MOEMS; Murata, H., Fujiyoshi, K., Nakatake, S., Kajitani, Y., Rectangle packing based module placement (1995) International Conference on Computer-Aided Design, pp. 472-479; Adya, S.N., Markov, I.L., Fixed-outline floorplanning: Enabling hierarchical design (2003) IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration Systems, 11 (6), pp. 1120-1135; http://www.algorithmic-solutions.com/leda/http://vlsicad.eecs.umich.edu/BK/parquet/","Tsai, M.-C.; Department of Computer Science, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan; 電子郵件： vodams@gmail.com",,"Shanghai Jiao Tong University;Digital Signal Processing Technical Committee;Biomedical Circuits and Systems Technical Committee",,"1st International Conference on Green Circuits and Systems, ICGCS 2010","21 June 2010 through 23 June 2010","Shanghai",81681,,9781424468775,,,"English","Int.

In this paper, we studied the problem of simultaneous double via insertion and wire bending (DVI/WB) in a postrouting stage, where a single via can have at most one redundant via inserted next to it. Aside from this, we are allowed to bend existing signal wires for enhancing the insertion rate of double vias. The primary goal of the DVI/WB problem is to insert as many double vias as possible; the secondary objective is to minimize the amount of layout perturbation. We formulate the DVI/WB problem as that of finding a minimum-weight maximum independent set (mWMIS) on an enhanced conflict graph. We proposed algorithms to perform wire bending and to construct the enhanced conflict graph from a given design. We also proposed a zero-one integer linear program (01 ILP)-based approach to solve the mWMIS problem. Moreover, we studied the problem of DVI/WB with the consideration of via density and extended our 01 ILP-based approach to solve it. Experimental results show that our approaches can improve the insertion rate by up to 6.34% at the expense of up to 1.29% wirelength increase when compared with the state-of-the-art double via insertion methods that do not consider wire bending.

To solve this layer assignment problem, we present an algorithm which first determines a net order, then applies a dynamic programming technique to perform layer assignment in a net-by-net manner according to the net order, and finally refines the solution iteratively until convergence. Our algorithm is guaranteed to always generate a layer assignment solution satisfying the wire congestion constraints.

The DVI problem can be naturally formulated as a zero-one integer linear program (0-1 ILP). Our main contributions are acceleration methods for reducing the problem size and the number of constraints. Moreover, we extend the 0-1 ILP formulation to handle via density constraints.

In addressing this problem, we take the total overflow and the maximum overflow as the congestion constraints from a given one-layer global routing solution and aim to find a layer assignment result for each net such that the via cost is minimized while the given congestion constraints are satisfied. To solve the problem, we propose a polynomial-time algorithm which first generates a net order and then performs layer assignment one net at a time according to the order using dynamic programming. Our algorithm is guaranteed to generate a layer assignment solution satisfying the given congestion constraints. We used the six-layer benchmarks released from the ISPD'07 global routing contest to test our algorithm. The experimental results show that our algorithm was able to improve the contest results of the top three winners MaizeRouter, BoxRouter, and FGR on each benchmark. As compared to BoxRouter 2.0 and FGR 1.1, which are newer versions of BoxRouter and FGR, our algorithm respectively produced smaller via costs on all benchmarks and half the benchmarks. Our algorithm can also be adapted to refine a given multilayer global routing solution in a net-by-net manner, and the experimental results show that this refinement approach improved the via costs on all benchmarks for FGR 1.1. © 2008 IEEE.","Global routing; Layer assignment; Physical design; Via minimization","Algorithms; Boolean functions; Computer networks; Mathematical programming; Multilayers; Systems engineering; Global routing; Layer assignment; Physical design; Via minimization; Routing algorithms",,,,,,"Kastner, R., Bozogzadeh, E., Sarrafzadeh, M., Predictable routing (2000) Proc.

NTHU-Route is based on iterative rip-ups and reroutes, and several techniques are proposed to enhance our global router. These techniques include (1) a history based cost function which helps to distribute overflow during iterative rip-ups and reroutes, (2) an adaptive multi-source multi-sink maze routing method to improve the wirelength of maze routing, (3) a congested region identification method to specify the order for nets to be ripped up and rerouted, and (4) a refinement process to further reduce overflow when iterative history based rip-ups and reroutes reach bottleneck. Compared with two state-of-the-art works on ISPD98 benchmarks, NTHU-Route outperforms them in both overflow and wirelength. For the much larger designs from the ISPD07 benchmark suite, our solution quality is better than or comparable to the best results reported in the ISPD07 routing contest. ©2008 IEEE.",,"Benchmarking; Computer aided design; Digital integrated circuits; History; Industrial engineering; Marine biology; Design automation conference; Maze routing; Multi-source; Refinement process; Region identification; Solution quality; South Pacific; Two-state; Wire lengths; Iterative methods",,,,,,"Carden, R., Li, J., Cheng, C.K., A global router with a theoretical bound on the optimal solution (1996) IEEE Trans. on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems, 15, pp. 208-216; Albrecht, C., Global routing by new approximation algorithms for multicommodity flow (2001) IEEE Trans. on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems, 20, pp. 622-632; Hadsell, R.T., Madden, P.H., Improved global routing through congestion estimation (2003) Proc. of Design Automation Conference, pp. 28-31; Kastner, R., Bozorgzadeh, E., Sarrafzadeh, M., Pattern routing: Use and theory for increasing predictability and avoiding coupling (2002) IEEE Trans. on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems, 21, pp. 777-790; Cao, Z., Jing, T., Xiong, J., Hu, Y., He, L., Hong, X., Dprouter: A fast and accurate dynamic-pattern-based global routing algorithm (2007) Proc.

In this paper, we study the problem of double-cut via insertion (DVI) in a post-routing stage, where a single via can have at most one redundant via inserted next to it and the goal is to insert as many redundant vias as possible. The DVI problem can be naturally formulated as a zero-one integer linear program (0-1 ILP). Our main contributions are acceleration methods for reducing the problem size and the number of constraints. Moreover, we extend the 0-1 ILP formulation to handle via density constraints. Experimental results show that our 0-1 ILP is very efficient in computing optimal DVI solution, with up to 35.3 times speedup over existing heuristic algorithms.

Consideration of process variations becomes critical to ensure high parametric timing yield. During the design stage, fast estimation of the achievable buffered delay can navigate more accurate and efficient wire planning and timing analysis in floorplanning or global routing. In this paper, we derive approximated first-order canonical forms for buffered delay estimation which considers the effect of process variations and the presence of buffer blockages. We empirically show that an existing deterministic delay estimation method will be over-pessimistic and thus result in unnecessary design rollback. The experimental results also show that our method can estimate buffered delay with 4% average error but achieve up to 149 times speedup when compared to a state-of-the-art statistical buffer insertion method. © 2007 IEEE.",,"Computer aided design; Digital integrated circuits; Error analysis; Industrial engineering; Mechanization; Routing algorithms; Time delay; Time measurement; Average errors; buffer insertion; Canonical forms; Delay estimation; Design automation conference (DAC); design stages; Deterministic delays; Experimental results; Fast estimation; first orders; Floor-planning; Global routing; Manufactured circuits; Process Technologies (CO); Process variations; South Pacific; Timing Analysis; wire planning; Estimation",,,,,,"Saxena, P., Menezes, N., Cocchini, P., Kirkpatrick, D.A., Repeater scaling and its impact on CAD (2004) IEEE Trans. on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems, 23 (4), pp. 451-463. , Apr; Alpert, C.J., Hu, J., Sapatnekar, S.S., Sze, C.N., Accurate estimation of global buffer delay within a floorplan (2006) IEEE Trans. on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems, 25 (6), pp. 1140-1146. , Jun; Otten, R.H.J.M., Global wires harmful?

Today's design often contains rectilinear obstacles, like macro cells, IP blocks, and pre-routed nets. Therefore obstacle-avoiding RSMT (OARSMT) construction becomes a very practical problem. In this paper we present a fast and stable algorithm for this problem. We use a partitioning based method and an ant colony optimization based method to construct obstacle-avoiding Steiner minimal tree (OASMT). Besides, two heuristics are proposed to do the rectilinearization and refinement to further improve wirelegnth.

The work function of HfxTayN gate electrodes can be adjusted by incorporating various nitrogen contents. It is found that the HfxTayN metal gate with higher nitrogen content can achieve better electrical characteristics in terms of leakage current and reliability while with only a slight increase in equivalent-oxide-thickness value. The face that only slight variation on electrical characteristics of MOS device with HfxTayN gate electrodes is observed after various PMA temperatures designates the excellent thermal stability of Hf xTayN gate electrodes.

However, if the amount of inserted redundant vias is not well controlled, it could violate via density rules and adversely worsen the yield and reliability of the design. In this paper, we first study the problem of redundant via insertion, and present two methods to accelerate a state-of-the-art approach (which is based on a maximum independent set (MIS) formulation) to solve it. We then consider the problem of simultaneous redundant via insertion and line end extension. We formulate the problem as a maximum weighted independent set (MWIS) problem and modify the accelerated MIS-based approach to solve it. Lastly, we investigate the problem of simultaneous redundant via insertion and line end extension subject to the maximum via density rule, and present a two-stage approach for it. In the first stage, we ignore the maximum via density rule, and enhance the MWIS-based approach to find the set of regions which violate the maximum via density rule after performing simultaneous redundant via insertion and line end extension. In the second stage, excess redundant vias are removed from those violating regions such that after the removal, the maximum via density rule is met while the total amount of redundant vias removed is minimized. This density-aware redundant via removal problem is formulated as a set of zero-one integer linear programming (0-1 ILP) problems each of which can be solved independently without sacrificing the optimality. The superiorities of our approaches are all demonstrated through promising experimental results.

There are many previously proposed repair methodologies, such as the popular repair methodology based on the concept of address remapping mechanism achieved by address comparison and address reconfiguration. However, a BISR design with a typical address remapping mechanism usually involves significant timing penalty. Therefore, we propose a new address remapping scheme with a write buffer to reduce the timing penalty. Our experiments show that with the proposed address remapping scheme and redundancy architecture, the timing penalty of our BISR scheme is the same with that of the Built-in Self-Test (BIST) circuit - only one multiplexer delay for both the inputs and outputs. © 2006 IEEE.",,"Buffer storage; Built-in self test; Computer architecture; Storage allocation (computer); Redundancy repair; Remapping scheme; Static random access storage",,,,,,"International technology roadmap for semiconductors (ITRS) (2003) Hsinchu, , Semiconductor Industry Association, 2003 edition, Taiwan, Dec; Nicolaidis, M., Achouri, N., Boutobza, S., Dynamic data-bit memory built-in self-repair (2003) Proc.

In this paper we study the problem of post-routing redundant via insertion and formulate it as a maximum independent set (MIS) problem. We present an efficient graph construction algorithm to model the problem, and an effective MIS heuristic to solve the problem. The experimental results show that our MIS heuristic inserts more redundant vias and distributes them more uniformly among via layers than a commercial tool and an existing method. The number of inserted redundant vias can be increased by up to 21.24%. Besides, since redundant vias can be classified into on-track and off-track ones, and on-track ones have better electrical properties, we also present two methods (one is modified from the MIS heuristic, and the other is applied as a post processor) to increase the amount of ontrack redundant vias.

Necking and voids at the via bottom were important in causing failures in tests of stress migration and electromigration. In this report, the contamination of the bottom of via, which results in poor step coverage, the adhesion of seed layers, and poor copper grain formation are identified to be the underlying causes of the necking and void formation after the first EM and SM tests are performed. The contamination of the via formation processes included via etching, trench etching, and barrier/seed layer depositions. A well-shaped via profile can be optimized using three methods, the first involves Cu/SiN interface stress, the second involves Cu grain growth, and the third involves post via etching clean study. Eliminating the contamination of the via bottom and optimizing step coverage and adhesion of the barrier seed layers improve the EM and SM performance from time-to-fail = 13 to 59 s, in the copper-related processes for fabricating 300 mm wafers using technology that is beyond 0.13 μm technology. © 2004 The Electrochemical Society.

The algorithms are based on the corner block list representation. In the first method only free modules are included in each corner block list. While placing each free module from a given corner block list, the method checks for overlaps with pre-placed modules and removes the overlaps by shifting the free module to the right or to the top. The second method includes all modules in each corner block list. If a newly inserted free module overlaps with a pre-placed module, it is swapped with the pre-placed module in the corner block list. If the newly inserted module is a pre-placed module but not in its pre-placed location, we defer the placement of pre-placed module and swap it with the next free module in the corner block list to place at the current location. The first algorithm runs in O (n × p) time and the second algorithm runs in O((n + p) × p) time where n is the number of free modules and p is the number of pre-placed modules. The algorithms are combined with the simulated annealing technique.

We present an efficient approach to the problem under the assumption that two metal layers are available for routing in each of the two over-the-cell regions and three metal layers are available for routing in the channel. The idea of our approach is to treat the three routing regions as a two-layer expanded channel, and to generate a two-layer channel routing solution first. The solution is then transformed into the final over-the-cell channel routing solution with the objective of minimizing the resulting width of the original channel. The transformation problem is reduced to the constrained two-processor scheduling problem for which we develop a polynomial time optimal algorithm.

In comparison with the conventional two-dimensional field-programmable gate array (FPGA) routing structure, this class of routing structures has the advantage of using a smaller number of active programmable switches. An existing field-programmable interconnect chip (FPIC) routing structure can be included as a special case in our class of routing structures. Using a probabilistic model, we prove that complete routing can be achieved with a high degree of probability in a routing structure of this class in which the number of tracks in each channel approaches the lower bound asymptotically.

Since our single net routing problem is NP-complete, a polynomial time approximate algorithm is proposed. We prove that our single net routing algorithm produces an optimal solution for some special classes of bipartite graphs.

Given two adjacent channels separated by a cell row, and a set of nets in each of the two channels, this problem is to assign to the cell row a subset of nets in each channel such that without violating any given constraint, the sum of the remaining densities of the two channels is minimized. The capacity constraint requires the density caused by the nets, which are assigned to the cell row, to be no more than a user-specified number k, where k is no more than the number of tracks available for routing over that cell row. The selection constraint specifies in each channel the subset of nets which are candidates to be assigned to the cell row. The routing constraint requires each net to be either completely assigned to the cell row or to stay in its channel. This problem can find its application in modeling a practical over-the-cell routing problem in which the whole region over the cell row is two-layer routable for the nets in the two adjacent channels.

For large floorplans, this approach may fail due to insufficient memory space available to store the implementations of sub-floorplans generated during the computation. An effective method to reduce memory usage is as follows: During the computation, whenever the set of non-redundant implementations of a sub-floorplan exceeds a certain predefined size, we only retain a subset of the implementations that can best approximate the original set. In this paper, we present two algorithms to optimally select implementations for rectangular and L-shaped sub-floorplans. Our algorithms can be applied to existing floorplan area optimization algorithms such as [3-7] to improve their performances. The common key idea of our two algorithms is to reduce the problem of optimally selecting a subset of implementations to a constrained shortest path problem, which we can solve optimally in polynomial time. We have incorporated the two algorithms into [7] and obtained very encouraging experimental results. © 1993.","constrained shortest path; floorplan area optimization; Floorplan design","Algorithms; Design; Graphic methods; Integrated circuit layout; Mathematical models; Optimization; Constrained shortest path; Floorplan area optimization; Floorplan design; VLSI circuits",,,,,,"Otten, Efficient floorplan optimization (1983) Proc.

Experimental results indicate that our algorithm performs well.",,"Algorithms; C (programming language); Electric network topology; Integrated circuit layout; Piecewise linear techniques; Curve adding technique; Floorplans; Nonredundant implementations; Piecewise linear decreasing shape curve; Shape curves; Tree restructuring technique; VLSI circuits",,,,,,,"Wang, Ting-Chi; Univ of Texas at Austin, Austin, United States",,"IEEE Computer Soc;IEEE Benelux Section;EDAC Assoc;Alcatel Bell, Belg;CAVE (CEC);et al","Publ by IEEE, Piscataway, NJ, United States","Proceedings the European Conference on Design Automation","16 March 1992 through 19 March 1992","Amsterdam, Neth",16675,,0818626453,,,"English",,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027060174

For large floorplans, this approach may fail due to insufficient memory space available to store the implementations of sub-floorplans generated during the computation. To effectively reduce both memory usage and running time, we present in this paper two algorithms to optimally reduce the number of implementations for rectangular and L-shaped sub-floorplans. The common key idea of our two algorithms is to reduce the problem to a constrained shortest path problem, which we can solve optimally in polynomial time. Our algorithms are designed specifically for [10] but they can also be applied to other algorithms such as [4,6,12] as well.
